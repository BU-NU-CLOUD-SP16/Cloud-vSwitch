## Prerequisies

The deployment of Cloud vSwitch requires a cloud environment and a portal to place your own vSwitch portal. After the deployment, you can earily and directly get access to the virtual LAN in the cloud! 

## Default installation

By default, we use the MOC to hold the cloud side. However, Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and similiar service by other providers should also be able to setup this VPN as a Service.
